# Statement of Purpose and Scope

## Description of the application

This is a simple terminal application which allows the user to fetch a random Chuck Norris Joke and allows them to save the joke to a file on the local file system. Chuck Norris has personally approved the application as the legend of Chuck Norris will never die.

The application relies on ruby runtime as it's not compiled into a binary code.

## Identify the issue that it resolves

This application doesn't resolve anything for the users, it is made with intent to give entertainment with bite size Chuck Norris joke, one at a time.

I am making this application not with the intent to make money or solving any particular problems faced by me or other people. I made this application to solidify my understanding of Ruby language and also practice the new concepts I have learned in class. The only way to improve coding is through practice and this application has given me plenty of chance to practice writing Ruby codes and markdowns.

## Target Audience

This application is intended for people who have knowledge of operating a terminal in either Linux or Mac environment or for people who can follow the documentations. It's not meant for general Window OS users as I am not sure if this will even run in the Window shell. Also it's mandatory for users to have ruby run time installed with version 2.5.1 or above

## How will the audience use it

The audience will use this application with the guide of the README documentation provided. The documentation will provide information on how to run in dev mode and also in production mode.

The audience use the application inside a terminal which provides both the output and input
